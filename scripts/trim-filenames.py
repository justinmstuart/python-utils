Filename Trimming Utility

This script provides functionality to recursively trim a specified number of characters
from the beginning of all filenames in a directory and its subdirectories. It's useful
for batch renaming files when they have unwanted prefixes.

Features:
    - Recursive processing of directories and subdirectories
    - User-configurable number of characters to trim
    - Environment variable support for directory path
    - Comprehensive error handling and validation
    - Detailed progress reporting and summary statistics
    - Safe handling of file conflicts and edge cases

Usage:
    Run the script directly:
        python trim-filenames.py

    Or set environment variable:
        export TRIM_FILENAMES_DIR="/path/to/directory"
        python trim-filenames.py

Environment Variables:
    TRIM_FILENAMES_DIR (optional): Directory path to process files in
